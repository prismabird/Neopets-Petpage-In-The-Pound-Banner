Userscript that displays a simple banner at the top of a Neopet's petpage reading "✨ [IN THE POUND] ✨" if a Neopet's owner is "none". 

Requires the use of an extension that allows installation of userscripts, eg. Tampermonkey. 

This is intended to be used to speed up stuck pet searching that relies on use of petpages, eg. via the spreadsheet "search all tabs" method at /~Dewyday. 

This script should perfectly legal, as it does not modify the page any more than a dark theme extension does. It ONLY checks the refer link (at the top of every vanilla Neopets petpage, the yellow and black banner ad) for "username=none". No data is modified or sent. The "IN THE POUND" display is client side only.
